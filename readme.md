# PBR: Pre-Built Racing Mod

![PBR logo](/images/pbr.jpg?raw=true)

PBR is a mod generator for Crypt of the NecroDancer that takes a seed and produces a mod with unique starting items and a rebalanced item pool.

## Rationale

As seen in CoNDOR Season 5, many races are being decided by luck instead of skill - who checks the right shops, who gets rewarded for going the "wrong" way, and so on.  PBR aims to solve this problem by giving both racers a solid starting build, and by removing or restricting any items that could be used to gain a significant lead from the item pool.  The goal is for races to be decided primarily on enemy handling, efficiency, and mapping, rather than build variance.

## Things to Know

Players use the Hard Mode (Seeded) stairs to race, using the same seed as the one given to PBR.  Hard Mode only removes trapdoors when this mod is active.

The following actions are banned in this mod:

* **Killing the main shopkeeper.**  This must not happen due to the potential to cause seed variance.
* **Killing secret shopkeepers.**  If this is done by accident, the racer must not take any unpaid-for items from the shop.
* **Activating shrines.**  This must not happen if the shrine has persistent effects; for other shrines like Luck / Pain / Uncertainty, the racer must not take any items from it.
* **Bombing shrines.**  If this occurs by accident, the racer must not take the item dropped.

Shopkeeper and shrine sprites have a text warning overlaid to remind racers of these bans.

## Starting Equipment

* **Weapon:** any titanium or obsidian weapon (except dagger and whip), or any special dagger or gun
* **Shovel:** any except basic
* **Headgear:** any except glass jaw or crown of greed
* **Armor:** any except karate gi
* **Footwear:** any
* **Torch:** any
* **Ring:** any except shadows or becoming / wonder
* **Spells:** any except transmute; 25% chance of 2nd spell
* **HUD:** either backpack or holster, 50/50
* **Misc / charms:** 10% chance of each pickup except potion, bomb charm, grenade charm, and lucky charm

## Item Chances

* The following items are removed from the item pool:
    - **Weapons:** all cats, rapiers, axes, special daggers, and guns
    - **Shovels:** shovel of courage
    - **Headgear:** miner's cap, monocle, and glass jaw
    - **Footwear:** boots of leaping, lunging, and pain
    - **Torches:** torch of walls
    - **All rings and spells**
    - **Misc / charms:** bag of holding, map, compass, and strength charm
    - **Scrolls:** enchant weapon scroll and scroll of need
    - **Consumables:** magic drumstick, magic ham, and magic cookies
* The following items are removed from chests and containers:
    - **All headgear, armor, and footwear**
* The following items are restricted to locked shops:
    - **Weapons:** all remaining titanium, obsidian, and glass weapons
    - **Shovels:** shovel of strength
    - **Headgear:** sunglasses and spiked ears
    - **Footwear:** boots of strength
    - **Torches:** torch of strength
* The following items are restricted to Zone 2+ boss chests (and are the **only** items you will find in such chests):
    - **Red:** blast helm, grenade charm, bomb charm, 3 bombs
    - **Black:** all armor except karate gi and leather
    - **Purple:** *(same as all other purple chests - scrolls and tomes)*

## Basic Meta

* Zone 1 boss chests are generally unfavorable compared to zone 2 and onward.  Black will contain a blood or gold weapon, red will not contain bomb-related items.  This is an artifact of the way item tiers work in the game and can't be "fixed" by modding without introducing these items to the zone 2+ level 3 shops and chests.
* If you started with a holster, consider checking black chests on the normal floors for a blood or gold weapon to provide gold quick-kills or blood healing.  Even without the holster, switching might be viable if you started with a damage-up item.  (Don't expect to find any axes to complement your ring of war, though.)
* Purple chests only contain scrolls and tomes, so if you have a consumable you want to keep, don't bother checking purple after flawlessing your boss.
* Since your zone 2+ boss red chests are guaranteed to give you extra bombs (or bomb charm), you don't have to worry about holding onto some critical threshold of bombs, as long as you're confident you can flawless 4-4 or Dead Ringer.
