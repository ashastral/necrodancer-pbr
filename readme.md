# PBR: Pre-Built Racing Mod

PBR is a mod generator for Crypt of the NecroDancer that takes a seed and produces a mod with unique starting items and a rebalanced item pool.

## Rationale

As seen in CoNDOR Season 5, many races are being decided by luck instead of skill - who checks the right shops, who gets rewarded for going the "wrong" way, and so on.  PBR aims to solve this problem by giving both racers a solid starting build, and by removing or restricting any items that could be used to gain a significant lead from the item pool.  The goal is for races to be decided primarily on enemy handling, efficiency, and mapping, rather than build variance.

## Things to Know

Players start with the following equipment:

* **Weapon:** any titanium or obsidian weapon (except dagger and whip), or any special dagger or gun
* **Shovel:** any except basic
* **Headgear:** any except glass jaw or crown of greed
* **Armor:** any except karate gi
* **Footwear:** any
* **Torch:** any
* **Ring:** any except shadows or becoming / wonder
* **Spells:** any except transmute; 25% chance of 2nd spell
* **HUD:** either backpack or holster, 50/50
* **Misc / charms:** 10% chance of each pickup except potion, bomb charm, grenade charm, and lucky charm

Item chances are modified from the base game as follows:

* The following items are removed from the item pool:
    - **Weapons:** all cats, rapiers, axes, special daggers, and guns
    - **Shovels:** courage and strength
    - **Headgear:** miner's cap and glass jaw
    - **Footwear:** boots of leaping, lunging, and pain
    - **Torches:** torch of walls
    - **All rings and spells**
    - **Misc / charms:** bag of holding, map, compass, bomb charm, grenade charm, and strength charm
    - **Scrolls:** enchant weapon and need
    - **Consumables:** magic drumstick, magic ham, and magic cookies
* The following items are restricted to the Zone 2+ boss chests:
    - **Headgear:** blast helm  
    - **Armor:** platemail, heavy plate
    - **Misc / charms:** grenade charm, bomb charm
* The following items are restricted to locked shops:
    - **Weapons:** all remaining titanium, obsidian, and glass weapons (no cats, rapiers, or axes)
* Zone 2+ boss chests contain only the following items:
    - **Red:** blast helm, grenade charm, bomb charm, 3 bombs
    - **Purple:** *unmodified (scrolls and tomes)*
    - **Black:** all armor except karate gi and leather

Some basic meta you should know as a racer:

* Zone 1 boss chests are generally unfavorable compared to zone 2 and onward.  Black will contain a blood or gold weapon, red will not contain bomb-related items.  This is an artifact of the way item tiers work in the game and can't be "fixed" by modding without introducing these items to the zone 2+ level 3 shops and chests.
* If you started with a holster, consider checking black chests on the normal floors for a blood or gold weapon to provide gold quick-kills or blood healing.  Even without the holster, switching might be viable if you started with a damage-up item.  (Don't expect to find any axes to complement your ring of war, though.)
* Purple chests only contain scrolls and tomes, so if you have a consumable you want to keep, don't bother checking purple after flawlessing your boss.
* Since your zone 2+ boss red chests are guaranteed to give you extra bombs (or bomb charm), you don't have to worry about holding onto some critical threshold of bombs, as long as you're confident you can flawless 4-4 or Dead Ringer.
